            <p>
                I created an animated sunset background that transitions into a night sky with randomly generated stars and occasional shooting stars.
                The aim was to improve visual appeal while demonstrating the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together.

            <h5>🛠 What I Did</h5>
            <p>
                The sunset was created using CSS keyframe animations to move the sun below the horizon and darken the sky.
                Stars were dynamically generated using JavaScript with random sizes, positions, and animation timings.
                Shooting stars appear at random intervals and fade quickly to mimic real meteor movement.

            <h5>⚠️ Challenges</h5>
            <p>
                Shooting stars initially felt unrealistic. This was fixed by refining animation timing, easing functions, and reducing frequency.
                Layering issues were solved using z-index and fixed positioning.
